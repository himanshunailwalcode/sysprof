Inotify is currently an executable that takes in as arguments the directories the user wishes to monitor. So far I've been running
it as ./inotify /etc /etc/ssh /home/rxiao3. Every 15 seconds (this is adjustable), it will spit out the following statistics in 
2 lines:

Line 1: how many files have been accessed, how many files have had their attributes changed, how many files have been modified, and
how many files have been opened (all since the last 15 second interval)

Line 2: the access alerts, the attribute modification alerts, the modification alerts, and the read alerts 
(all since the last 15 second interval). Alerts indicate potentially suspicious activity
